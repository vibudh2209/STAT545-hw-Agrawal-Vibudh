Things that i found difficult were:

- Applying piping and ggplot together
- Coming up with some new different and unique plots

Apart from the above most of the other things including basic plotting like scatter plot, histogram, density plots etc were not very difficult, on the other hand ggplot is an amazing tool for plotting as it allows to make a variety of plots with great ease.

The following source were used by me for help:

- Tutorial by Jenny which has details about each and every plot types [Here](https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial)
- Class notes on ggplot was also helpful [Here](https://stat545.com/cm006-notes_and_exercises.html)
