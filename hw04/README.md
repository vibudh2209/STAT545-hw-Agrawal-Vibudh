# The process

The things I found difficult are as follows:

- Gather for me was not very straigtforward and it difficult to know when to use which command (gather,spread,melt or dcast)
- In activity 4 it took me some time to get one row for each year as directly it was not possible to use spread or some other function
- Making cheatsheets took me some time as selecting which is the best data to use and what all should I include in my cheatsheet took some time

The things which were not so difficult:

- Using join commands are pretty straighforward and not much thinking is required as long as ou know which command does what
- Spread is pretty easy to use and same goes for dcast
- Creating and mending data frame is also not so difficult
