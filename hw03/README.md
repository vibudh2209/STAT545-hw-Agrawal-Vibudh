After doing last few homeworks implementing ggplot was not very difficult, so ones the relevant data has been extracted its not very difficult to plot as well as tabulate it.

So the difficult part is just to get to the data which is relevant. But after working with dplyr in last few classes as well as homework, its not very difficult to extract the relevant data using multiple functions available in dplyr package.

One thing I like to mention is that I am still not very comfortable with changing the layout and theme of plots constructed using ggplot.

The following sources were used by me:

- For different type of plots [this](https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial), a tutorial given by Jenny
- For changing themes and facet wrap [this](https://stat545.com/cm008-notes_and_exercises.html), the class notes
- For line plots [this](https://stat545.com/cm007-notes_and_exercises.html), again class notes
