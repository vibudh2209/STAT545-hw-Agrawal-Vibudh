# Welcome to hw03 by Vibudh Agrawal

The link to markdown file is [this](https://github.com/vibudh2209/STAT545-hw-Agrawal-Vibudh/blob/master/hw03/Hw03.md), you will find all the answered questions there.

The link to table and figure side by side is [this](https://github.com/vibudh2209/STAT545-hw-Agrawal-Vibudh/blob/master/hw03/Side_side.md) (Markdown link) and [this](https://github.com/vibudh2209/STAT545-hw-Agrawal-Vibudh/blob/master/hw03/Side_side.html) (HTML link). But I don't understand why knit in Rstdio gives proper side by side figure but here markdown is not showing that.

After doing last few homeworks implementing ggplot was not very difficult, so ones the relevant data has been extracted its not very difficult to plot as well as tabulate it.

So the difficult part is just to get to the data which is relevant. But after working with dplyr in last few classes as well as homework, its not very difficult to extract the relevant data using multiple functions available in dplyr package.

One thing I like to mention is that I am still not very comfortable with changing the layout and theme of plots constructed using ggplot.

Applying table and figure side by side was little difficult as firstly we have to make html file for that and as the file was more than 1.4mb it was not shown in github. The markdown file was not showing graphs when html file was made (thus have to commit seperately for html and md file). Hoping that there was a way to do so in github document instead of using html document.

So for showing table and figure side by side I made a different markdown file.

The following sources were used by me:

- For different type of plots [this](https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial), a tutorial given by Jenny
- For changing themes and facet wrap [this](https://stat545.com/cm008-notes_and_exercises.html), the class notes
- For line plots [this](https://stat545.com/cm007-notes_and_exercises.html), again class notes
- For tables and figures side by side [this](https://gist.github.com/jennybc/e9e9aba6ba18c72cec26#file-2015-03-02_plot-next-to-table-rmd)
