# Hi welcome to Homework 5

# Report of the process:

- For the activity **Factor Management** it took me some time to compare order of factors generated by different saving types. Transforming a variable to factor was pretty easy, and also showing how to remove levels when filter was not difficult.

- I was trying to order the factors using minimum or maximum value of one variable but was not able to do so (I have no clue why it didn't worked).

- For visualisation it was pretty straighforward if I followed the syntax.

- It took me some time to figure out the cases in which ggsave will work differently without specifying the plot to be saved.


Resources used are as follows:

- For working with factors I again resorted to the [class notes](http://stat545.com/block029_factors.html) and for reading and writing files again [class notes](http://stat545.com/block026_file-out-in.html)
- For visualisation and saving plots the [class notes](http://stat545.com/cm013-notes_and_exercises.html) were very helpful
